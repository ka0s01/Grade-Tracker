# GPA Calculator
This is a simple GPA Calculator, Mark Tracker I built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
--

## What It Does

- Lets you add courses with credits

- Enter marks for CAT-1, CAT-2, DAs and FAT

- Automatically calculates weightages

- Computes total marks and grade points

- Calculates overall GPA

- Stores everything in localStorage 

- Lets you delete individual courses

## Things I Focused On

- Avoid using annoying alert popups

- Add proper input validation (limits, no negatives, grade restrictions)

- Give visual feedback when inputs are valid or invalid

- Separatation of logic (ex: not mixing deletion with render)


## What I Learned From This Project

- How to dynamically create and update table rows

- Managing state using a central state object

- Working with dataset attributes

- Handling different types of events (input, keydown, blur)

- Preventing invalid inputs

- Using localStorage


## Future Improvements

- Auto-update GPA without clicking a button

- Add semester tracking

- Add export to CSV

- Add GPA graph

- Calculating derived values cleanly

- Refactoring messy logic into cleaner functions
